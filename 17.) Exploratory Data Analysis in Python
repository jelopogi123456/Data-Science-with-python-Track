Read the codebook
When you work with datasets like the NSFG, it is important to read the documentation carefully. If you interpret a variable incorrectly, you can generate nonsense results and never realize it. So before you start coding, you'll need to get familiar with the NSFG codebook, which describes every variable.

Here is the documentation from the NSFG codebook for "BIRTHWGT_OZ1":

birthwgt_oz1 codebook

How many respondents refused to answer this question?

Exploring the NSFG data
To get the number of rows and columns in a DataFrame, you can read its shape attribute.

To get the column names, you can read the columns attribute. The result is an Index, which is a Pandas data structure that is similar to a list. Let's begin exploring the NSFG data! It has been pre-loaded for you into a DataFrame called nsfg.

Instructions 1/4
25 XP
Calculate the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame nsfg.

# Display the number of rows and columns
print(nsfg.shape)
Display the names of the columns in nsfg.


# Display the number of rows and columns
nsfg.shape

# Display the names of the columns
nsfg.columns

Select the column 'birthwgt_oz1' and assign it to a new variable called ounces.


# Display the number of rows and columns
nsfg.shape

# Display the names of the columns
nsfg.columns

# Select column birthwgt_oz1: ounces
ounces = nsfg['birthwgt_oz1']

Display the first 5 elements of ounces.

# Display the number of rows and columns
nsfg.shape

# Display the names of the columns
nsfg.columns

# Select column birthwgt_oz1: ounces
ounces = nsfg['birthwgt_oz1']

# Print the first 5 elements of ounces
print(ounces.head())


Validate a variable
In the NSFG dataset, the variable 'outcome' encodes the outcome of each pregnancy as shown below:

value	label
1	Live birth
2	Induced abortion
3	Stillbirth
4	Miscarriage
5	Ectopic pregnancy
6	Current pregnancy
The nsfg DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you. Explore it in the IPython Shell and use the methods Allen showed you in the video to answer the following question: How many pregnancies in this dataset ended with a live birth?

Clean a variable
In the NSFG dataset, the variable 'nbrnaliv' records the number of babies born alive at the end of a pregnancy.

If you use .value_counts() to view the responses, you'll see that the value 8 appears once, and if you consult the codebook, you'll see that this value indicates that the respondent refused to answer the question.

Your job in this exercise is to replace this value with np.nan. Recall from the video how Allen replaced the values 98 and 99 in the ounces column using the .replace() method:

ounces.replace([98, 99], np.nan, inplace=True)
Instructions
100 XP
In the 'nbrnaliv' column, replace the value 8, in place, with the special value NaN.
Confirm that the value 8 no longer appears in this column by printing the values and their frequencies.

# Replace the value 8 with NaN
nsfg['nbrnaliv'].replace(8, np.nan, inplace = True)

# Print the values and their frequencies
print(nsfg['nbrnaliv'].value_counts())

Compute a variable
For each pregnancy in the NSFG dataset, the variable 'agecon' encodes the respondent's age at conception, and 'agepreg' the respondent's age at the end of the pregnancy.

Both variables are recorded as integers with two implicit decimal places, so the value 2575 means that the respondent's age was 25.75.

Instructions 1/3
35 XP
Select 'agecon' and 'agepreg', divide them by 100, and assign them to the local variables agecon and agepreg.

# Select the columns and divide by 100
agecon = nsfg['agecon'] / 100
agepreg = nsfg['agepreg'] / 100

Instructions 2/3
35 XP
Compute the difference, which is an estimate of the duration of the pregnancy. Keep in mind that for each pregnancy, agepreg will be larger than agecon.

# Select the columns and divide by 100
agecon = nsfg['agecon'] / 100
agepreg = nsfg['agepreg'] / 100

# Compute the difference
preg_length = agepreg - agecon

Use .describe() to compute the mean duration and other summary statistics.

# Select the columns and divide by 100
agecon = nsfg['agecon'] / 100
agepreg = nsfg['agepreg'] / 100

# Compute the difference
preg_length = agepreg - agecon

# Compute summary statistics
print(preg_length.describe())

Make a histogram
Histograms are one of the most useful tools in exploratory data analysis. They quickly give you an overview of the distribution of a variable, that is, what values the variable can have, and how many times each value appears.

As we saw in a previous exercise, the NSFG dataset includes a variable 'agecon' that records age at conception for each pregnancy. Here, you're going to plot a histogram of this variable. You'll use the bins parameter that you saw in the video, and also a new parameter - histtype - which you can read more about here in the matplotlib documentation. Learning how to read documentation is an essential skill. If you want to learn more about matplotlib, you can check out DataCamp's Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib course.

Instructions 1/2
50 XP
Plot a histogram of agecon with 20 bins.

# Plot the histogram
plt.hist(agecon , bins = 20)

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Age at conception')
plt.ylabel('Number of pregnancies')

# Show the figure
plt.show()

Adapt your code to make an unfilled histogram by setting the parameter histtype to be 'step'.



# Plot the histogram
plt.hist(agecon, bins=20, histtype='step')

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Age at conception')
plt.ylabel('Number of pregnancies')

# Show the figure
plt.show()

Compute birth weight
Now let's pull together the steps in this chapter to compute the average birth weight for full-term babies.

I've provided a function, resample_rows_weighted, that takes the NSFG data and resamples it using the sampling weights in wgt2013_2015. The result is a sample that is representative of the U.S. population.

Then I extract birthwgt_lb1 and birthwgt_oz1, replace special codes with NaN, and compute total birth weight in pounds, birth_weight.

# Resample the data
nsfg = resample_rows_weighted(nsfg, 'wgt2013_2015')

# Clean the weight variables
pounds = nsfg['birthwgt_lb1'].replace([98, 99], np.nan)
ounces = nsfg['birthwgt_oz1'].replace([98, 99], np.nan)

# Compute total birth weight
birth_weight = pounds + ounces/16
Instructions
100 XP
Make a Boolean Series called full_term that is true for babies with 'prglngth' greater than or equal to 37 weeks.
Use full_term and birth_weight to select birth weight in pounds for full-term babies. Store the result in full_term_weight.
Compute the mean weight of full-term babies.

# Create a Boolean Series for full-term babies
full_term = nsfg['prglngth'] >= 37

# Select the weights of full-term babies
full_term_weight = birth_weight[full_term]

# Compute the mean weight of full-term babies
print(full_term_weight.mean())

Filter
In the previous exercise, you computed the mean birth weight for full-term babies; you filtered out preterm babies because their distribution of weight is different.

The distribution of weight is also different for multiple births, like twins and triplets. In this exercise, you'll filter them out, too, and see what effect it has on the mean.

Instructions
100 XP
Use the variable 'nbrnaliv' to make a Boolean Series that is True for single births (where 'nbrnaliv' equals 1) and False otherwise.
Use Boolean Series and logical operators to select single, full-term babies and compute their mean birth weight.
For comparison, select multiple, full-term babies and compute their mean birth weight.



# Filter full-term babies
full_term = nsfg['prglngth'] >= 37

# Filter single births
single = nsfg['nbrnaliv']== 1

# Compute birth weight for single full-term babies
single_full_term_weight = birth_weight[single & full_term]
print('Single full-term mean:', single_full_term_weight.mean())

# Compute birth weight for multiple full-term babies
mult_full_term_weight = birth_weight[~single & full_term]
print('Multiple full-term mean:', mult_full_term_weight.mean())


Make a PMF
The GSS dataset has been pre-loaded for you into a DataFrame called gss. You can explore it in the IPython Shell to get familiar with it.

In this exercise, you'll focus on one variable in this dataset, 'year', which represents the year each respondent was interviewed.

The Pmf class you saw in the video has already been created for you. You can access it outside of DataCamp via the empiricaldist library.

Instructions 1/2
50 XP
Make a PMF for year with normalize=False and display the result.

# Compute the PMF for year

Question
How many respondents were interviewed in 2016?

Plot a PMF
Now let's plot a PMF for the age of the respondents in the GSS dataset. The variable 'age' contains respondents' age in years.

Instructions 1/3
35 XP
Select the 'age' column from the gss DataFrame and store the result in age.

# Select the age column
age = gss['age']

Make a normalized PMF of age. Store the result in pmf_age.


# Select the age column
age = gss['age']

# Make a PMF of age
pmf_age = Pmf(gss['age'], normalize = True)

Plot pmf_age as a bar chart.


# Select the age column
age = gss['age']

# Make a PMF of age
pmf_age = Pmf(age)

# Plot the PMF
pmf_age.bar()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('PMF')
plt.show()

Make a CDF
In this exercise, you'll make a CDF and use it to determine the fraction of respondents in the GSS dataset who are OLDER than 30.

The GSS dataset has been preloaded for you into a DataFrame called gss.

As with the Pmf class from the previous lesson, the Cdf class you just saw in the video has been created for you, and you can access it outside of DataCamp via the empiricaldist library.

Instructions 1/4
25 XP
Select the 'age' column. Store the result in age.

# Select the age column
age = gss['age']

Compute the CDF of age. Store the result in cdf_age.


# Select the age column
age = gss['age']

# Compute the CDF of age
cdf_age = Cdf(age)

Calculate the CDF of 30.


# Select the age column
age = gss['age']

# Compute the CDF of age
cdf_age = Cdf(age)

# Calculate the CDF of 30
print(cdf_age(30))

Question
What fraction of the respondents in the GSS dataset are OLDER than 30?

Approximately 75%

Compute IQR
Recall from the video that the interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles. It is a measure of variability that is robust in the presence of errors or extreme values.

In this exercise, you'll compute the interquartile range of income in the GSS dataset. Income is stored in the 'realinc' column, and the CDF of income has already been computed and stored in cdf_income.

Instructions 1/4
25 XP
Calculate the 75th percentile of income and store it in percentile_75th.

# Calculate the 75th percentile 
percentile_75th = cdf_income.inverse(0.75)

Calculate the 25th percentile of income and store it in percentile_25th.



# Calculate the 75th percentile 
percentile_75th = cdf_income.inverse(0.75)

# Calculate the 25th percentile
percentile_25th = cdf_income.inverse(0.25)


Calculate the interquartile range of income. Store the result in iqr.



# Calculate the 75th percentile 
percentile_75th = cdf_income.inverse(0.75)

# Calculate the 25th percentile
percentile_25th = cdf_income.inverse(0.25)

# Calculate the interquartile range
iqr = percentile_75th - percentile_25th

# Print the interquartile range
print(iqr)

Question
What is the interquartile range (IQR) of income in the GSS dataset?

Possible Answers

Approximately 29676



Plot a CDF
The distribution of income in almost every country is long-tailed; that is, there are a small number of people with very high incomes.

In the GSS dataset, the variable 'realinc' represents total household income, converted to 1986 dollars. We can get a sense of the shape of this distribution by plotting the CDF.

Instructions
100 XP
Select 'realinc' from the gss dataset.
Make a Cdf object called cdf_income.
Create a plot of cdf_income using .plot().

# Select realinc
income = gss['realinc']

# Make the CDF
cdf_income = Cdf(income)

# Plot it
cdf_income.plot()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Income (1986 USD)')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.show()

Distribution of education
Let's begin comparing incomes for different levels of education in the GSS dataset, which has been pre-loaded for you into a DataFrame called gss. The variable educ represents the respondent's years of education.

What fraction of respondents report that they have 12 years of education or fewer?
Approximately 53%



Extract education levels
Let's create Boolean Series to identify respondents with different levels of education.

In the U.S, 12 years of education usually means the respondent has completed high school (secondary education). A respondent with 14 years of education has probably completed an associate degree (two years of college); someone with 16 years has probably completed a bachelor's degree (four years of college).

Instructions
100 XP
Instructions
100 XP
Complete the line that identifies respondents with associate degrees, that is, people with 14 or more years of education but less than 16.
Complete the line that identifies respondents with 12 or fewer years of education.
Confirm that the mean of high is the fraction we computed in the previous exercise, about 53%.

# Select educ
educ = gss['educ']

# Bachelor's degree
bach = (educ >= 16)

# Associate degree
assc = ((educ >= 14) & (educ < 16))
# High school (12 or fewer years of education)
high =  (educ <= 12)
print(high.mean())

Plot income CDFs
Let's now see what the distribution of income looks like for people with different education levels. You can do this by plotting the CDFs. Recall how Allen plotted the income CDFs of respondents interviewed before and after 1995:

Cdf(income[pre95]).plot(label='Before 1995')
Cdf(income[~pre95]).plot(label='After 1995')
You can assume that Boolean Series have been defined, as in the previous exercise, to identify respondents with different education levels: high, assc, and bach.

Instructions
100 XP
Fill in the missing lines of code to plot the CDFs.

income = gss['realinc']

# Plot the CDFs
Cdf(income[high]).plot(label='High school')
Cdf(income[assc]).plot(label='Associate')
Cdf(income[bach]).plot(label='Bachelor')

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Income (1986 USD)')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

Distribution of income
In many datasets, the distribution of income is approximately lognormal, which means that the logarithms of the incomes fit a normal distribution. We'll see whether that's true for the GSS data. As a first step, you'll compute the mean and standard deviation of the log of incomes using NumPy's np.log10() function.

Then, you'll use the computed mean and standard deviation to make a norm object using the scipy.stats.norm() function.

Instructions
100 XP
Extract 'realinc' from gss and compute its logarithm using np.log10().
Compute the mean and standard deviation of the result.
Make a norm object by passing the computed mean and standard deviation to norm().

# Extract realinc and compute its log
income = gss['realinc']
log_income = np.log10(income)

# Compute mean and standard deviation
mean = log_income.mean()
std = log_income.std()
print(mean, std)

# Make a norm object
from scipy.stats import norm
dist = norm(mean,std)

Comparing CDFs
To see whether the distribution of income is well modeled by a lognormal distribution, we'll compare the CDF of the logarithm of the data to a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation. These variables from the previous exercise are available for use:

# Extract realinc and compute its log
log_income = np.log10(gss['realinc'])

# Compute mean and standard deviation
mean, std = log_income.mean(), log_income.std()

# Make a norm object
from scipy.stats import norm
dist = norm(mean, std)
dist is a scipy.stats.norm object with the same mean and standard deviation as the data. It provides .cdf(), which evaluates the normal cumulative distribution function.

Be careful with capitalization: Cdf(), with an uppercase C, creates Cdf objects. dist.cdf(), with a lowercase c, evaluates the normal cumulative distribution function.

Instructions
100 XP
Evaluate the normal cumulative distribution function using dist.cdf.
Use the Cdf() function to compute the CDF of log_income.
Plot the result.

# Evaluate the model CDF
xs = np.linspace(2, 5.5)
ys = dist.cdf(xs)

# Plot the model CDF
plt.clf()
plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray')

# Create and plot the Cdf of log_income
Cdf(log_income).plot()
    
# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('log10 of realinc')
plt.ylabel('CDF')
plt.show()

Comparing PDFs
In the previous exercise, we used CDFs to see if the distribution of income is lognormal. We can make the same comparison using a PDF and KDE. That's what you'll do in this exercise!

As before, the norm object dist is available in your workspace:

from scipy.stats import norm
dist = norm(mean, std)
Just as all norm objects have a .cdf() method, they also have a .pdf() method.

To create a KDE plot, you can use Seaborn's kdeplot() function. Here, Seaborn has been imported for you as sns.

Instructions
100 XP
Evaluate the normal PDF using dist, which is a norm object with the same mean and standard deviation as the data.
Make a KDE plot of the logarithms of the incomes, using log_income, which is a Series object.

# Evaluate the normal PDF
xs = np.linspace(2, 5.5)
ys = dist.pdf(xs)

# Plot the model PDF
plt.clf()
plt.plot(xs, ys, color='gray')

# Plot the data KDE
sns.kdeplot(log_income)

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('log10 of realinc')
plt.ylabel('PDF')
plt.show()

PMF of age
Do people tend to gain weight as they get older? We can answer this question by visualizing the relationship between weight and age. But before we make a scatter plot, it is a good idea to visualize distributions one variable at a time. Here, you'll visualize age using a bar chart first. Recall that all PMF objects have a .bar() method to make a bar chart.

The BRFSS dataset includes a variable, 'AGE' (note the capitalization!), which represents each respondent's age. To protect respondents' privacy, ages are rounded off into 5-year bins. 'AGE' contains the midpoint of the bins.

Instructions
100 XP
Extract the variable 'AGE' from the DataFrame brfss and assign it to age.
Get the PMF of age and plot it as a bar chart.

# Extract age
age = brfss['AGE']

# Plot the PMF
pmf_age = Pmf(age)
pmf_age.bar()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Age in years')
plt.ylabel('PMF')
plt.show()

Scatter plot
Now let's make a scatterplot of weight versus age. To make the code run faster, I've selected only the first 1000 rows from the brfss DataFrame.

weight and age have already been extracted for you. Your job is to use plt.plot() to make a scatter plot.

Instructions
100 XP
Make a scatter plot of weight and age with format string 'o' and alpha=0.1.

# Select the first 1000 respondents
brfss = brfss[:1000]

# Extract age and weight
age = brfss['AGE']
weight = brfss['WTKG3']

# Make a scatter plot
plt.plot(age,weight , 'o', alpha=0.1)

plt.xlabel('Age in years')
plt.ylabel('Weight in kg')

plt.show()

Jittering
In the previous exercise, the ages fall in columns because they've been rounded into 5-year bins. If we jitter them, the scatter plot will show the relationship more clearly. Recall how Allen jittered height and weight in the video:

height_jitter = height + np.random.normal(0, 2, size=len(brfss))
weight_jitter = weight + np.random.normal(0, 2, size=len(brfss))
Instructions
100 XP
Add random noise to age with mean 0 and standard deviation 2.5.
Make a scatter plot between weight and age with marker size 5 and alpha=0.2. Be sure to also specify 'o'.
# Select the first 1000 respondents
brfss = brfss[:1000]

# Add jittering to age
age = brfss['AGE'] + np.random.normal(0, 2.5, size=len(brfss))
# Extract weight
weight = brfss['WTKG3']

# Make a scatter plot
plt.plot(age, weight, 'o', markersize=5, alpha=0.2)

plt.xlabel('Age in years')
plt.ylabel('Weight in kg')
plt.show()

Height and weight
Previously we looked at a scatter plot of height and weight, and saw that taller people tend to be heavier. Now let's take a closer look using a box plot. The brfss DataFrame contains a variable '_HTMG10' that represents height in centimeters, binned into 10 cm groups.

Recall how Allen created the box plot of 'AGE' and 'WTKG3' in the video, with the y-axis on a logarithmic scale:

sns.boxplot(x='AGE', y='WTKG3', data=data, whis=10)
plt.yscale('log')
Instructions
100 XP
Fill in the parameters of .boxplot() to plot the distribution of weight ('WTKG3') in each height ('_HTMG10') group. Specify whis=10, just as was done in the video.
Add a line to plot the y-axis on a logarithmic scale.

# Drop rows with missing data
data = brfss.dropna(subset=['_HTMG10', 'WTKG3'])

# Make a box plot
sns.boxplot(x='_HTMG10', y='WTKG3', data=data, whis=10)

# Plot the y-axis on a log scale
plt.yscale('log')


# Remove unneeded lines and label axes
sns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)
plt.xlabel('Height in cm')
plt.ylabel('Weight in kg')
plt.show()


Distribution of income
In the next two exercises we'll look at relationships between income and other variables. In the BRFSS, income is represented as a categorical variable; that is, respondents are assigned to one of 8 income categories. The variable name is 'INCOME2'. Before we connect income with anything else, let's look at the distribution by computing the PMF. Recall that all Pmf objects have a .bar() method.

Instructions
100 XP
Extract 'INCOME2' from the brfss DataFrame and assign it to income.
Plot the PMF of income as a bar chart.

# Extract income
income = brfss['INCOME2']

# Plot the PMF
pmf_income = Pmf(income).bar()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Income level')
plt.ylabel('PMF')
plt.show()


Income and height
Let's now use a violin plot to visualize the relationship between income and height.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a violin plot to plot the distribution of height ('HTM4') in each income ('INCOME2') group. Specify inner=None to simplify the plot.

# Drop rows with missing data
data = brfss.dropna(subset=['INCOME2', 'HTM4'])

# Make a violin plot
sns.violinplot(x='INCOME2', y='HTM4' , inner = None, data = data)

# Remove unneeded lines and label axes
sns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)
plt.xlabel('Income level')
plt.ylabel('Height in cm')
plt.show()


Computing correlations
The purpose of the BRFSS is to explore health risk factors, so it includes questions about diet. The variable '_VEGESU1' represents the number of servings of vegetables respondents reported eating per day.

Let's see how this variable relates to age and income.

Instructions
100 XP
From the brfss DataFrame, select the columns 'AGE', 'INCOME2', and '_VEGESU1'.
Compute the correlation matrix for these variables.

# Select columns
columns = ['AGE', 'INCOME2', '_VEGESU1']
subset = brfss[columns]

# Compute the correlation matrix
print(subset.corr())

Income and vegetables
As we saw in a previous exercise, the variable '_VEGESU1' represents the number of vegetable servings respondents reported eating per day.

Let's estimate the slope of the relationship between vegetable consumption and income.

Instructions
100 XP
Extract the columns 'INCOME2' and '_VEGESU1' from subset into xs and ys respectively.
Compute the simple linear regression of these variables.

from scipy.stats import linregress

# Extract the variables
subset = brfss.dropna(subset=['INCOME2', '_VEGESU1'])
xs = subset['INCOME2']
ys = subset['_VEGESU1']

# Compute the linear regression
res = linregress(xs,ys)
print(res)

Fit a line
Continuing from the previous exercise:

Assume that xs and ys contain income codes and daily vegetable consumption, respectively, and

res contains the results of a simple linear regression of ys onto xs.

Now, you're going to compute the line of best fit. NumPy has been imported for you as np.

Instructions
100 XP
Set fx to the minimum and maximum of xs, stored in a NumPy array.
Set fy to the points on the fitted line that correspond to the fx.

# Plot the scatter plot
plt.clf()
x_jitter = xs + np.random.normal(0, 0.15, len(xs))
plt.plot(x_jitter, ys, 'o', alpha=0.2)

# Plot the line of best fit
fx = np.array([xs.min(), xs.max()])
fy = res.intercept + res.slope * fx
plt.plot(fx, fy, '-', alpha=0.7)

plt.xlabel('Income code')
plt.ylabel('Vegetable servings per day')
plt.ylim([0, 6])
plt.show()

Using StatsModels
Let's run the same regression using SciPy and StatsModels, and confirm we get the same results.

Instructions
100 XP
Compute the regression of '_VEGESU1' as a function of 'INCOME2' using SciPy's linregress().
Compute the regression of '_VEGESU1' as a function of 'INCOME2' using StatsModels' smf.ols().

from scipy.stats import linregress
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Run regression with linregress
subset = brfss.dropna(subset=['INCOME2', '_VEGESU1'])
xs = subset['INCOME2']
ys = subset['_VEGESU1']
res = linregress (xs,ys)
print(res)

# Run regression with StatsModels
results = smf.ols('_VEGESU1 ~ INCOME2', data = brfss).fit()
print(results.params)

Plot income and education
To get a closer look at the relationship between income and education, let's use the variable 'educ' to group the data, then plot mean income in each group.

Here, the GSS dataset has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame called gss.

Instructions
100 XP
Group gss by 'educ'. Store the result in grouped.
From grouped, extract 'realinc' and compute the mean.
Plot mean_income_by_educ as a scatter plot. Specify 'o' and alpha=0.5.

# Group by educ
grouped = gss.groupby('educ')

# Compute mean income in each group
mean_income_by_educ = grouped['realinc'].mean()

# Plot mean income as a scatter plot
plt.plot(mean_income_by_educ , 'o', alpha= 0.5)

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Education (years)')
plt.ylabel('Income (1986 $)')
plt.show()

Non-linear model of education
The graph in the previous exercise suggests that the relationship between income and education is non-linear. So let's try fitting a non-linear model.

Instructions
100 XP
Add a column named 'educ2' to the gss DataFrame; it should contain the values from 'educ' squared.
Run a regression model that uses 'educ', 'educ2', 'age', and 'age2' to predict 'realinc'.

import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Add a new column with educ squared
gss['educ2'] = gss['educ']**2

# Run a regression model with educ, educ2, age, and age2
results = smf.ols('realinc~ educ +  educ2 +  age + age2' , data = gss).fit()

# Print the estimated parameters

Making predictions
At this point, we have a model that predicts income using age, education, and sex.

Let's see what it predicts for different levels of education, holding age constant.

Instructions
100 XP
Using np.linspace(), add a variable named 'educ' to df with a range of values from 0 to 20.
Add a variable named 'age' with the constant value 30.
Use df to generate predicted income as a function of education.

# Run a regression model with educ, educ2, age, and age2
results = smf.ols('realinc ~ educ + educ2 + age + age2', data=gss).fit()

# Make the DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame()
df['educ'] = np.linspace(0, 20)
df['age'] = 30
df['educ2'] = df['educ']**2
df['age2'] = df['age']**2

# Generate and plot the predictions
pred = results.predict(df)
print(pred.head())

Visualizing predictions
Now let's visualize the results from the previous exercise!

Instructions
100 XP
Plot mean_income_by_educ using circles ('o'). Specify an alpha of 0.5.
Plot the prediction results with a line, with df['educ'] on the x-axis and pred on the y-axis.



# Plot mean income in each age group
plt.clf()
grouped = gss.groupby('educ')
mean_income_by_educ = grouped['realinc'].mean()
plt.plot(mean_income_by_educ, 'o', alpha=0.5)

# Plot the predictions
pred = results.predict(df)
plt.plot(df['educ'], pred, label='Age 30')

# Label axes
plt.xlabel('Education (years)')
plt.ylabel('Income (1986 $)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

Predicting a binary variable
Let's use logistic regression to predict a binary variable. Specifically, we'll use age, sex, and education level to predict support for legalizing cannabis (marijuana) in the U.S.

In the GSS dataset, the variable grass records the answer to the question "Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?"

Instructions 1/4
25 XP
Fill in the parameters of smf.logit() to predict grass using the variables age, age2, educ, and educ2, along with sex as a categorical variable.

# Recode grass
gss['grass'].replace(2, 0, inplace=True)

# Run logistic regression
results = smf.logit('grass~ + age + age2 + educ + educ2 + C(sex)' , data = gss ).fit()
results.params

Add a column called educ and set it to 12 years; then compute a second column, educ2, which is the square of educ.


# Recode grass
gss['grass'].replace(2, 0, inplace=True)

# Run logistic regression
results = smf.logit('grass ~ age + age2 + educ + educ2 + C(sex)', data=gss).fit()
results.params

# Make a DataFrame with a range of ages
df = pd.DataFrame()
df['age'] = np.linspace(18, 89)
df['age2'] = df['age']**2

# Set the education level to 12
df['educ'] = 12
df['educ2'] = df['educ']**2

Generate separate predictions for men and women.


# Recode grass
gss['grass'].replace(2, 0, inplace=True)

# Run logistic regression
results = smf.logit('grass ~ age + age2 + educ + educ2 + C(sex)', data=gss).fit()
results.params

# Make a DataFrame with a range of ages
df = pd.DataFrame()
df['age'] = np.linspace(18, 89)
df['age2'] = df['age']**2

# Set the education level to 12
df['educ'] = 12
df['educ2'] = df['educ']**2

# Generate predictions for men and women
df['sex'] = 1
pred1 = results.predict(df)

df['sex'] = 2
pred2 = results.predict(df)

Fill in the missing code to compute the mean of 'grass' for each age group, and then the arguments of plt.plot() to plot pred2 versus df['age'] with the label 'Female'.


# Recode grass
gss['grass'].replace(2, 0, inplace=True)

# Run logistic regression
results = smf.logit('grass ~ age + age2 + educ + educ2 + C(sex)', data=gss).fit()
results.params

# Make a DataFrame with a range of ages
df = pd.DataFrame()
df['age'] = np.linspace(18, 89)
df['age2'] = df['age']**2

# Set the education level to 12
df['educ'] = 12
df['educ2'] = df['educ']**2

# Generate predictions for men and women
df['sex'] = 1
pred1 = results.predict(df)

df['sex'] = 2
pred2 = results.predict(df)

plt.clf()
grouped = gss.groupby('age')
favor_by_age = grouped['grass'].mean()
plt.plot(favor_by_age, 'o', alpha=0.5)

plt.plot(df['age'], pred1, label='Male')
plt.plot(pred2 , df['age'], label = 'Female')

plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Probability of favoring legalization')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
