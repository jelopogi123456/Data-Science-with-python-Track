k-Nearest Neighbors: Fit
In this exercise, you will build your first classification model using the churn_df dataset, which has been preloaded for the remainder of the chapter.

The features to use will be "account_length" and "customer_service_calls". The target, "churn", needs to be a single column with the same number of observations as the feature data.

You will convert the features and the target variable into NumPy arrays, create an instance of a KNN classifier, and then fit it to the data.

numpy has also been preloaded for you as np.

Instructions
100 XP
Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors.
Create an array called X containing values from the "account_length" and "customer_service_calls" columns, and an array called y for the values of the "churn" column.
Instantiate a KNeighborsClassifier called knn with 6 neighbors.
Fit the classifier to the data using the .fit() method.


# Import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier 

# Create arrays for the features and the target variable
y = churn_df["churn"].values
X = churn_df[["account_length", "customer_service_calls"]].values

# Create a KNN classifier with 6 neighbors
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X, y)


k-Nearest Neighbors: Predict
Now you have fit a KNN classifier, you can use it to predict the label of new data points. All available data was used for training, however, fortunately, there are new observations available. These have been preloaded for you as X_new.

The model knn, which you created and fit the data in the last exercise, has been preloaded for you. You will use your classifier to predict the labels of a set of new data points:

X_new = np.array([[30.0, 17.5],
                  [107.0, 24.1],
                  [213.0, 10.9]])
Instructions

Create y_pred by predicting the target values of the unseen features X_new.
Print the predicted labels for the set of predictions.

# Predict the labels for the X_new
y_pred = knn.predict(X_new)

# Print the predictions for X_new
print("Predictions: {}".format(y_pred)) 


Train/test split + computing accuracy
Now that you have learned about the importance of splitting your data into training and test sets, it's time to practice doing this on the churn_df dataset!

NumPy arrays have been created for you containing the features as X and the target variable as y. You will split them into training and test sets, fit a KNN classifier to the training data, and then compute its accuracy on the test data using the .score() method.

knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

# Fit the classifier to the training data
knn = knn.fit(X_train , y_train)

# Print the accuracy
print(knn.score(X_test, y_test))



Overfitting and underfitting
Interpreting model complexity is a great way to evaluate performance when utilizing supervised learning. Your aim is to produce a model that can interpret the relationship between features and the target variable, as well as generalize well when exposed to new observations.

You will generate accuracy scores for the training and test sets using a KNN classifier with different n_neighbor values, which you will plot in the next exercise.

The training and test sets have been created from the churn_df dataset and preloaded as X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.

# Create neighbors
neighbors = np.arange(1, 13)
train_accuracies = {}
test_accuracies = {}

for neighbor in neighbors:
  
	# Set up a KNN Classifier
	knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors= neighbor)
  
	# Fit the model
	knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
  
	# Compute accuracy
	train_accuracies[neighbor] = knn.score(X_train, y_train)
	test_accuracies[neighbor] = knn.score(X_test, y_test)
print(neighbors, '\n', train_accuracies, '\n', test_accuracies)


Visualizing model complexity
Now you have calculated the accuracy of the KNN model on the training and test sets using various values of n_neighbors, you can create a model complexity curve to visualize how performance changes as the model becomes less complex!

Creating features
In this chapter, you will work with a dataset called sales_df, which contains information on advertising campaign expenditure across different media types, and the number of dollars generated in sales for the respective campaign. The dataset has been preloaded for you. Here are the first two rows:

     tv        radio      social_media    sales
1    13000.0   9237.76    2409.57         46677.90
2    41000.0   15886.45   2913.41         150177.83
You will use the advertising expenditure as features to predict sales values, initially working with the "radio" column. However, before you make any predictions you will need to create the feature and target arrays, reshaping them to the correct format for scikit-learn.

# Create y from the sales column's values
y = sales_df["sales"].values

# Reshape X
X = X.reshape(-1, 1)

# Check the shape of the features and targets
print(X.shape, y.shape)



Building a linear regression model
Now you have created your feature and target arrays, you will train a linear regression model on all feature and target values.

As the goal is to assess the relationship between the feature and target values there is no need to split the data into training and test sets.

X and y have been preloaded for you as follows:

y = sales_df["sales"].values
X = sales_df["radio"].values.reshape(-1, 1)

# Make predictions
predictions = reg.predict(X)

print(predictions[:5])


Visualizing a linear regression model
Now you have built your linear regression model and trained it using all available observations, you can visualize how well the model fits the data. This allows you to interpret the relationship between radio advertising expenditure and sales values.

The variables X, an array of radio values, y, an array of sales values, and predictions, an array of the model's predicted values for y given X, have all been preloaded for you from the previous exercise.

2    41000.0   15886.45   2913.41         150177.83
You will then use this model to predict sales based on the values of the test features.

LinearRegression and train_test_split have been preloaded for you from their respective modules.

# Fit the model to the data
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)
print("Predictions: {}, Actual Values: {}".format(y_pred[:2], y_test[:2]))

Regression performance
Now you have fit a model, reg, using all features from sales_df, and made predictions of sales values, you can evaluate performance using some common regression metrics.

The variables X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, and y_pred, along with the fitted model, reg, all from the last exercise, have been preloaded for you.

# Print the metrics
print("R^2: {}".format(r_squared))
print("RMSE: {}".format(rmse))


Cross-validation for R-squared
Cross-validation is a vital approach to evaluating a model. It maximizes the amount of data that is available to the model, as the model is not only trained but also tested on all of the available data.

Assessing a diabetes prediction classifier
In this chapter you'll work with the diabetes_df dataset introduced previously.

The goal is to predict whether or not each individual is likely to have diabetes based on the features body mass index (BMI) and age (in years). Therefore, it is a binary classification problem. A target value of 0 indicates that the individual does not have diabetes, while a value of 1 indicates that the individual does have diabetes.

diabetes_df has been preloaded for you as a pandas DataFrame and split into X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test. In addition, a KNeighborsClassifier() has been instantiated and assigned to knn.

Pipeline for song genre prediction: II
Having set up the steps of the pipeline in the previous exercise, you will now use it on the music_df dataset to classify the genre of songs. What makes pipelines so incredibly useful is the simple interface that they provide.

X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test have been preloaded for you, and confusion_matrix has been imported from sklearn.metrics.

Instructions

Create a pipeline using the steps you previously defined.
Fit the pipeline to the training data.
Make predictions on the test set.
Calculate and print the confusion matrix.



steps = [("imputer", imp_mean),
        ("knn", knn)]

# Create the pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(steps)

# Fit the pipeline to the training data
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)

# Print the confusion matrix
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))


Centering and scaling for regression
Now you have seen the benefits of scaling your data, you will use a pipeline to preprocess the music_df features and build a lasso regression model to predict a song's loudness.

X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test have been created from the music_df dataset, where the target is "loudness" and the features are all other columns in the dataset. Lasso and Pipeline have also been imported for you.

Note that "genre" has been converted to a binary feature where 1 indicates a rock song, and 0 represents other genres.

Instructions
100 XP
Import StandardScaler.
Create the steps for the pipeline object, a StandardScaler object called "scaler", and a lasso model called "lasso" with alpha set to 0.5.
Instantiate a pipeline with steps to scale and build a lasso regression model.
Calculate the R-squared value on the test data.


# Import StandardScaler
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Create pipeline steps
steps = [("scaler", StandardScaler()),
         ("lasso", Lasso(alpha=0.5))]

# Instantiate the pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(steps)
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Calculate and print R-squared
print(pipeline.score(X_test, y_test))

Centering and scaling for classification
Now you will bring together scaling and model building into a pipeline for cross-validation.

Your task is to build a pipeline to scale features in the music_df dataset and perform grid search cross-validation using a logistic regression model with different values for the hyperparameter C. The target variable here is "genre", which contains binary values for rock as 1 and any other genre as 0.

StandardScaler, LogisticRegression, and GridSearchCV have all been imported for you.

Instructions
70 XP
Build the steps for the pipeline: a StandardScaler() object named "scaler", and a logistic regression model named "logreg".
Create the parameters, searching 20 equally spaced float values ranging from 0.001 to 1.0 for the logistic regression model's C hyperparameter within the pipeline.
Instantiate the grid search object.
Fit the grid search object to the training data.

# Build the steps
steps = [("scaler", StandardScaler()),
         ("logreg", LogisticRegression())]
pipeline = Pipeline(steps)

# Create the parameter space
parameters = {"logreg__C": np.linspace(0.001, 1.0, 20)}
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, 
                                                    random_state=21)

# Instantiate the grid search object
cv = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=parameters)

# Fit to the training data
cv.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(cv.best_score_, "\n", cv.best_params_)

Visualizing regression model performance
Now you have seen how to evaluate multiple models out of the box, you will build three regression models to predict a song's "energy" levels.

The music_df dataset has had dummy variables for "genre" added. Also, feature and target arrays have been created, and these have been split into X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.

The following have been imported for you: LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, cross_val_score, and KFold.

Instructions
100 XP
Write a for loop using model as the iterator, and model.values() as the iterable.
Perform cross-validation on the training features and the training target array using the model, setting cv equal to the KFold object.
Append the model's cross-validation scores to the results list.
Create a box plot displaying the results, with the x-axis labels as the names of the models.

models = {"Linear Regression": LinearRegression(), "Ridge": Ridge(alpha=0.1), "Lasso": Lasso(alpha=0.1)}
results = []

# Loop through the models' values
for model in models.values():
  kf = KFold(n_splits=6, random_state=42, shuffle=True)
  
  # Perform cross-validation
  cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=kf)
  
  # Append the results
  results.append(cv_scores)

# Create a box plot of the results
plt.boxplot(results, labels=models.keys())
plt.show()

Predicting on the test set
In the last exercise, linear regression and ridge appeared to produce similar results. It would be appropriate to select either of those models; however, you can check predictive performance on the test set to see if either one can outperform the other.

You will use root mean squared error (RMSE) as the metric. The dictionary models, containing the names and instances of the two models, has been preloaded for you along with the training and target arrays X_train_scaled, X_test_scaled, y_train, and y_test.

Instructions

Import mean_squared_error.
Fit the model to the scaled training features and the training labels.
Make predictions using the scaled test features.
Calculate RMSE by passing the test set labels and the predicted labels.

# Import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

for name, model in models.items():
  
  # Fit the model to the training data
  model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
  
  # Make predictions on the test set
  y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
  
  # Calculate the test_rmse
  test_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False)
  print("{} Test Set RMSE: {}".format(name, test_rmse))
  
  
  Visualizing classification model performance
In this exercise, you will be solving a classification problem where the "popularity" column in the music_df dataset has been converted to binary values, with 1 representing popularity more than or equal to the median for the "popularity" column, and 0 indicating popularity below the median.

Your task is to build and visualize the results of three different models to classify whether a song is popular or not.

The data has been split, scaled, and preloaded for you as X_train_scaled, X_test_scaled, y_train, and y_test. Additionally, KNeighborsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, and LogisticRegression have been imported.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a dictionary of "Logistic Regression", "KNN", and "Decision Tree Classifier", setting the dictionary's values to a call of each model.
Loop through the values in models.
Instantiate a KFold object to perform 6 splits, setting shuffle to True and random_state to 12.
Perform cross-validation using the model, the scaled training features, the target training set, and setting cv equal to kf


# Create models dictionary
models = {"Logistic Regression": LogisticRegression(), "KNN": KNeighborsClassifier(), "Decision Tree Classifier": DecisionTreeClassifier()}
results = []

# Loop through the models' values
for model in models.values():
  
  # Instantiate a KFold object
  kf = KFold(n_splits=6, random_state=12, shuffle=True)
  
  # Perform cross-validation
  cv_results = cross_val_score(model, X_train_scaled, y_train, cv=kf)
  results.append(cv_results)
plt.boxplot(results, labels=models.keys())
plt.show()


Pipeline for predicting song popularity
For the final exercise, you will build a pipeline to impute missing values, scale features, and perform hyperparameter tuning of a logistic regression model. The aim is to find the best parameters and accuracy when predicting song genre!

All the models and objects required to build the pipeline have been preloaded for you.

Instructions

Create the steps for the pipeline by calling a simple imputer, a standard scaler, and a logistic regression model.
Create a pipeline object, and pass the steps variable.
Instantiate a grid search object to perform cross-validation using the pipeline and the parameters.
Print the best parameters and compute and print the test set accuracy score for the grid search object.

# Create steps
steps = [("imp_mean", SimpleImputer()), 
         ("scaler", StandardScaler()), 
         ("logreg", LogisticRegression())]

# Set up pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(steps)
params = {"logreg__solver": ["newton-cg", "saga", "lbfgs"],
         "logreg__C": np.linspace(0.001, 1.0, 10)}

# Create the GridSearchCV object
tuning = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=params)
tuning.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = tuning.predict(X_test)

# Compute and print performance
print("Tuned Logistic Regression Parameters: {}, Accuracy: {}".format(tuning.best_params_, tuning.score(X_test, y_test)))
