Clustering 2D points
From the scatter plot of the previous exercise, you saw that the points seem to separate into 3 clusters. You'll now create a KMeans model to find 3 clusters, and fit it to the data points from the previous exercise. After the model has been fit, you'll obtain the cluster labels for some new points using the .predict() method.

You are given the array points from the previous exercise, and also an array new_points.

Instructions

Import KMeans from sklearn.cluster.
Using KMeans(), create a KMeans instance called model to find 3 clusters. To specify the number of clusters, use the n_clusters keyword argument.
Use the .fit() method of model to fit the model to the array of points points.
Use the .predict() method of model to predict the cluster labels of new_points, assigning the result to labels.
Hit submit to see the cluster labels of new_points.

# Import KMeans

# Create a KMeans instance with 3 clusters: model
model = KMeans(n_clusters = 3)

# Fit model to points

# Determine the cluster labels of new_points: labels
labels = model.predict(new_points)

# Print cluster labels of new_points
print(labels)



Inspect your clustering
Let's now inspect the clustering you performed in the previous exercise!

Make a scatter plot of xs and ys, specifying the c=labels keyword arguments to color the points by their cluster label. Also specify alpha=0.5.
Compute the coordinates of the centroids using the .cluster_centers_ attribute of model.
Assign column 0 of centroids to centroids_x, and column 1 of centroids to centroids_y.
Make a scatter plot of centroids_x and centroids_y, using 'D' (a diamond) as a marker by specifying the marker parameter. Set the size of the markers to be 50 using s=50.

Evaluating the grain clustering
In the previous exercise, you observed from the inertia plot that 3 is a good number of clusters for the grain data. In fact, the grain samples come from a mix of 3 different grain varieties: "Kama", "Rosa" and "Canadian". In this exercise, cluster the grain samples into three clusters, and compare the clusters to the grain varieties using a cross-tabulation.

You have the array samples of grain samples, and a list varieties giving the grain variety for each sample. Pandas (pd) and KMeans have already been imported for you.

Create a DataFrame df with two columns named 'labels' and 'varieties', using labels and varieties, respectively, for the column values. This has been done for you.
Use the pd.crosstab() function on df['labels'] and df['varieties'] to count the number of times each grain variety coincides with each cluster label. Assign the result to ct.

Scaling fish data for clustering
You are given an array samples giving measurements of fish. Each row represents an individual fish. The measurements, such as weight in grams, length in centimeters, and the percentage ratio of height to length, have very different scales. In order to cluster this data effectively, you'll need to standardize these features first. In this exercise, you'll build a pipeline to standardize and cluster the data.

These fish measurement data were sourced from the Journal of Statistics Education.

Import:
make_pipeline from sklearn.pipeline.
StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
KMeans from sklearn.cluster.
Create an instance of StandardScaler called scaler.
Create an instance of KMeans with 4 clusters called kmeans.
Create a pipeline called pipeline that chains scaler and kmeans. To do this, you just need to pass them in as arguments to make_pipeline().

scaler = StandardScaler()

# Create KMeans instance: kmeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 4)

# Create pipeline: pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(scaler, kmeans)



Clustering the fish data
You'll now use your standardization and clustering pipeline from the previous exercise to cluster the fish by their measurements, and then create a cross-tabulation to compare the cluster labels with the fish species.

As before, samples is the 2D array of fish measurements. Your pipeline is available as pipeline, and the species of every fish sample is given by the list species.

Instructions

Import pandas as pd.
Fit the pipeline to the fish measurements samples.
Obtain the cluster labels for samples by using the .predict() method of pipeline.
Using pd.DataFrame(), create a DataFrame df with two columns named 'labels' and 'species', using labels and species, respectively, for the column values.
Using pd.crosstab(), create a cross-tabulation ct of df['labels'] and df['species'].


# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Fit the pipeline to samples
pipeline.fit(samples)

# Calculate the cluster labels: labels
labels = pipeline.predict(samples)

# Create a DataFrame with labels and species as columns: df
df = pd.DataFrame({'labels' : labels , 'species' : species})

# Create crosstab: ct
ct = pd.crosstab(df['labels'] , df['species'])

# Display ct
print(ct)


Clustering stocks using KMeans
In this exercise, you'll cluster companies using their daily stock price movements (i.e. the dollar difference between the closing and opening prices for each trading day). You are given a NumPy array movements of daily price movements from 2010 to 2015 (obtained from Yahoo! Finance), where each row corresponds to a company, and each column corresponds to a trading day.

Some stocks are more expensive than others. To account for this, include a Normalizer at the beginning of your pipeline. The Normalizer will separately transform each company's stock price to a relative scale before the clustering begins.

Note that Normalizer() is different to StandardScaler(), which you used in the previous exercise. While StandardScaler() standardizes features (such as the features of the fish data from the previous exercise) by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, Normalizer() rescales each sample - here, each company's stock price - independently of the other.

KMeans and make_pipeline have already been imported for you.

Instructions
100 XP
Import Normalizer from sklearn.preprocessing.
Create an instance of Normalizer called normalizer.

# Import Normalizer
from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer

# Create a normalizer: normalizer
normalizer = Normalizer()

# Create a KMeans model with 10 clusters: kmeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 10)

Hierarchies of stocks
In chapter 1, you used k-means clustering to cluster companies according to their stock price movements. Now, you'll perform hierarchical clustering of the companies. You are given a NumPy array of price movements movements, where the rows correspond to companies, and a list of the company names companies. SciPy hierarchical clustering doesn't fit into a sklearn pipeline, so you'll need to use the normalize() function from sklearn.preprocessing instead of Normalizer.

Repeat the last step for 'Denzel Washington' (another actor).

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(nmf_features , index=titles)

# Print the row for 'Anne Hathaway'
print(df.loc['Anne Hathaway'])

# Print the row for 'Denzel Washington'
print(df.loc['Denzel Washington'])


NMF learns topics of documents
In the video, you learned when NMF is applied to documents, the components correspond to topics of documents, and the NMF features reconstruct the documents from the topics. Verify this for yourself for the NMF model that you built earlier using the Wikipedia articles. Previously, you saw that the 3rd NMF feature value was high for the articles about actors Anne Hathaway and Denzel Washington. In this exercise, identify the topic of the corresponding NMF component.

The NMF model you built earlier is available as model, while words is a list of the words that label the columns of the word-frequency array.

After you are done, take a moment to recognize the topic that the articles about Anne Hathaway and Denzel Washington have in common!

Import pandas as pd.
Create a DataFrame components_df from model.components_, setting columns=words so that columns are labeled by the words.
Print components_df.shape to check the dimensions of the DataFrame.
Use the .iloc[] accessor on the DataFrame components_df to select row 3. Assign the result to component.
Call the .nlargest() method of component, and print the result. This gives the five words with the highest values for that component.

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame: components_df
components_df = pd.DataFrame(model.components_ , columns=words)

# Print the shape of the DataFrame
print(components_df.shape)

# Select row 3: component
component = components_df.iloc[3,:]

# Print result of nlargest
print(component.nlargest())


Explore the LED digits dataset
In the following exercises, you'll use NMF to decompose grayscale images into their commonly occurring patterns. Firstly, explore the image dataset and see how it is encoded as an array. You are given 100 images as a 2D array samples, where each row represents a single 13x8 image. The images in your dataset are pictures of a LED digital display.

Instructions
0 XP
Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Select row 0 of samples and assign the result to digit. For example, to select column 2 of an array a, you could use a[:,2]. Remember that since samples is a NumPy array, you can't use the .loc[] or iloc[] accessors to select specific rows or columns.
Print digit. This has been done for you. Notice that it is a 1D array of 0s and 1s.
Use the .reshape() method of digit to get a 2D array with shape (13, 8). Assign the result to bitmap.
Print bitmap, and notice that the 1s show the digit 7!
Use the plt.imshow() function to display bitmap as an image.

# Import pyplot
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Select the 0th row: digit
digit = samples[0,:]

# Print digit
print(digit)

# Reshape digit to a 13x8 array: bitmap
bitmap = digit.reshape((13, 8))

# Print bitmap
print(bitmap)

# Use plt.imshow to display bitmap
plt.imshow(bitmap, cmap='gray', interpolation='nearest')
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()


NMF learns the parts of images
Now use what you've learned about NMF to decompose the digits dataset. You are again given the digit images as a 2D array samples. This time, you are also provided with a function show_as_image() that displays the image encoded by any 1D array:

def show_as_image(sample):
    bitmap = sample.reshape((13, 8))
    plt.figure()
    plt.imshow(bitmap, cmap='gray', interpolation='nearest')
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()
    
After you are done, take a moment to look through the plots and notice how NMF has expressed the digit as a sum of the components!

Instructions

Import NMF from sklearn.decomposition.
Create an NMF instance called model with 7 components. (7 is the number of cells in an LED display).
Apply the .fit_transform() method of model to samples. Assign the result to features.
To each component of the model (accessed via model.components_), apply the show_as_image() function to that component inside the loop.
Assign the row 0 of features to digit_features.
Print digit_features.


# Import NMF
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

# Create an NMF model: model
model = NMF(n_components=7)

# Apply fit_transform to samples: features
features = model.fit_transform(samples)

# Call show_as_image on each component
for component in model.components_:
    show_as_image(component)

# Select the 0th row of features: digit_features
digit_features = features[0,:]

# Print digit_features
print(digit_features)


PCA doesn't learn parts
Unlike NMF, PCA doesn't learn the parts of things. Its components do not correspond to topics (in the case of documents) or to parts of images, when trained on images. Verify this for yourself by inspecting the components of a PCA model fit to the dataset of LED digit images from the previous exercise. The images are available as a 2D array samples. Also available is a modified version of the show_as_image() function which colors a pixel red if the value is negative.

After submitting the answer, notice that the components of PCA do not represent meaningful parts of images of LED digits!

Recommend musical artists part I
In this exercise and the next, you'll use what you've learned about NMF to recommend popular music artists! You are given a sparse array artists whose rows correspond to artists and whose columns correspond to users. The entries give the number of times each artist was listened to by each user.

In this exercise, build a pipeline and transform the array into normalized NMF features. The first step in the pipeline, MaxAbsScaler, transforms the data so that all users have the same influence on the model, regardless of how many different artists they've listened to. In the next exercise, you'll use the resulting normalized NMF features for recommendation!
