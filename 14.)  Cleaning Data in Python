Cleaning Data in Python
Course Description
It's commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data and only 20% of their time analyzing it. The time spent cleaning is vital since analyzing dirty data can lead you to draw inaccurate conclusions. Data cleaning is an essential task in data science. Without properly cleaned data, the results of any data analysis or machine learning model could be inaccurate. In this course, you will learn how to identify, diagnose, and treat a variety of data cleaning problems in Python, ranging from simple to advanced. You will deal with improper data types, check that your data is in the correct range, handle missing data, perform record linkage, and more!

1. Common data problems
In this chapter, you'll learn how to overcome some of the most common dirty data problems. You'll convert data types, apply range constraints to remove future data points, and remove duplicated data points to avoid double-counting.

Numeric data or ... ?
In this exercise, and throughout this chapter, you'll be working with bicycle ride sharing data in San Francisco called ride_sharing. It contains information on the start and end stations, the trip duration, and some user information for a bike sharing service.

The user_type column contains information on whether a user is taking a free ride and takes on the following values:

1 for free riders. 2 for pay per ride. 3 for monthly subscribers. In this instance, you will print the information of ride_sharing using .info() and see a firsthand example of how an incorrect data type can flaw your analysis of the dataset. The pandas package is imported as pd.

Instructions

Print the information of ride_sharing.

Use .describe() to print the summary statistics of the user_type column from ride_sharing.

Convert user_type into categorical by assigning it the 'category' data type and store it in the user_type_cat column.

Make sure you converted user_type_cat correctly by using an assert statement.

import pandas as pd
ride_sharing = pd.read_csv('datasets/ride_sharing_new.csv')
ride_sharing.head()

# Print the information of ride_sharing
print(ride_sharing.info())

# Print summary statistics of user_type column
print(ride_sharing['user_type'].describe())

# Print the information of ride_sharing
print(ride_sharing.info())

# Print summary statistics of user_type column
print(ride_sharing['user_type'].describe())

# Convert user_type from integer to category
ride_sharing['user_type_cat'] = ride_sharing['user_type'].astype('category')

# Write an assert statement confirming the change
assert ride_sharing['user_type_cat'].dtype == 'category'

# Print new summary statistics 
print(ride_sharing['user_type_cat'].describe())

Summing strings and concatenating numbers
In the previous exercise, you were able to identify that category is the correct data type for user_type and convert it in order to extract relevant statistical summaries that shed light on the distribution of user_type.

Another common data type problem is importing what should be numerical values as strings, as mathematical operations such as summing and multiplication lead to string concatenation, not numerical outputs.

In this exercise, you'll be converting the string column duration to the type int. Before that however, you will need to make sure to strip "minutes" from the column in order to make sure pandas reads it as numerical. The pandas package has been imported as pd.

Instructions

Use the .strip() method to strip duration of "minutes" and store it in the duration_trim column.
Convert duration_trim to int and store it in the duration_time column.
Write an assert statement that checks if duration_time's data type is now an int.
Print the average ride duration.
# Strip duration of minutes
ride_sharing['duration_trim'] = ride_sharing['duration'].str.strip("minutes")

# Convert duration to integer
ride_sharing['duration_time'] = ride_sharing["duration_trim"].astype(int)

# Write an assert statement making sure of conversion
assert ride_sharing['duration_time'].dtype == 'int'

# Print formed columns and calculate average ride duration 
print(ride_sharing[['duration','duration_trim','duration_time']])
print((ride_sharing['duration_time']).mean())


Tire size constraints
In this lesson, you're going to build on top of the work you've been doing with the ride_sharing DataFrame. You'll be working with the tire_sizes column which contains data on each bike's tire size.

Bicycle tire sizes could be either 26″, 27″ or 29″ and are here correctly stored as a categorical value. In an effort to cut maintenance costs, the ride sharing provider decided to set the maximum tire size to be 27″.

In this exercise, you will make sure the tire_sizes column has the correct range by first converting it to an integer, then setting and testing the new upper limit of 27″ for tire sizes.

Instructions

Convert the tire_sizes column from category to 'int'.
Use .loc[] to set all values of tire_sizes above 27 to 27.
Reconvert back tire_sizes to 'category' from int.
Print the description of the tire_sizes.
# Convert tire_sizes to integer
ride_sharing['tire_sizes'] = ride_sharing['tire_sizes'].astype('int')

# Set all values above 27 to 27
ride_sharing.loc[ride_sharing['tire_sizes'] > 27, "tire_sizes"] = 27

# Reconvert tire_sizes back to categorical
ride_sharing['tire_sizes'] = ride_sharing['tire_sizes'].astype("category")

# Print tire size description
print(ride_sharing['tire_sizes'].describe())
Back to the future
A new update to the data pipeline feeding into the ride_sharing DataFrame has been updated to register each ride's date. This information is stored in the ride_date column of the type object, which represents strings in pandas.

A bug was discovered which was relaying rides taken today as taken next year. To fix this, you will find all instances of the ride_date column that occur anytime in the future, and set the maximum possible value of this column to today's date. Before doing so, you would need to convert ride_date to a datetime object.

The datetime package has been imported as dt, alongside all the packages you've been using till now.

Instructions

Convert ride_date to a datetime object and store it in ride_dt column using to_datetime().
Create the variable today, which stores today's date by using the dt.date.today() function.
For all instances of ride_dt in the future, set them to today's date.
Print the maximum date in the ride_dt column.
# Convert ride_date to datetime
ride_sharing['ride_dt'] = pd.to_datetime(ride_sharing['ride_date'])

# Save today's date
today = dt.date.today()

# Set all in the future to today's date
ride_sharing.loc[ride_sharing['ride_dt'] > today, 'ride_dt'] = today

# Print maximum of ride_dt column
print(ride_sharing['ride_dt'].max())
Finding duplicates
A new update to the data pipeline feeding into ride_sharing has added the ride_id column, which represents a unique identifier for each ride.

The update however coincided with radically shorter average ride duration times and irregular user birth dates set in the future. Most importantly, the number of rides taken has increased by 20% overnight, leading you to think there might be both complete and incomplete duplicates in the ride_sharing DataFrame.

In this exercise, you will confirm this suspicion by finding those duplicates. A sample of ride_sharing is in your environment, as well as all the packages you've been working with thus far.

Instructions

Find duplicated rows of ride_id in the ride_sharing DataFrame while setting keep to False.
Subset ride_sharing on duplicates and sort by ride_id and assign the results to duplicated_rides.
Print the ride_id, duration and user_birth_year columns of duplicated_rides in that order.
# Find duplicates
duplicates = ride_sharing.duplicated('ride_id', keep=False)

# Sort your duplicated rides
duplicated_rides = ride_sharing[duplicates].sort_values('ride_id')

# Print relevant columns of duplicated_rides
print(duplicated_rides[['ride_id','duration','user_birth_year']])
Treating duplicates
In the last exercise, you were able to verify that the new update feeding into ride_sharing contains a bug generating both complete and incomplete duplicated rows for some values of the ride_id column, with occasional discrepant values for the user_birth_year and duration columns.

In this exercise, you will be treating those duplicated rows by first dropping complete duplicates, and then merging the incomplete duplicate rows into one while keeping the average duration, and the minimum user_birth_year for each set of incomplete duplicate rows.

Instructions

Drop complete duplicates in ride_sharing and store the results in ride_dup.
Create the statistics dictionary which holds minimum aggregation for user_birth_year and mean aggregation for duration.
Drop incomplete duplicates by grouping by ride_id and applying the aggregation in statistics.
Find duplicates again and run the assert statement to verify de-duplication.
# Drop complete duplicates from ride_sharing
ride_dup = ride_sharing.drop_duplicates()

# Create statistics dictionary for aggregation function
statistics = {'user_birth_year': 'min', 'duration': 'mean'}

# Group by ride_id and compute new statistics
ride_unique = ride_sharing.groupby('ride_id').agg(statistics).reset_index()

# Find duplicated values again
duplicates = ride_unique.duplicated(subset = 'ride_id', keep = False)
duplicated_rides = ride_unique[duplicates == True]

# Assert duplicates are processed
assert duplicated_rides.shape[0] == 0
2. Text and categorical data problems
Categorical and text data can often be some of the messiest parts of a dataset due to their unstructured nature. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to fix whitespace and capitalization inconsistencies in category labels, collapse multiple categories into one, and reformat strings for consistency.

Finding consistency
In this exercise and throughout this chapter, you'll be working with the airlines DataFrame which contains survey responses on the San Francisco Airport from airline customers.

The DataFrame contains flight metadata such as the airline, the destination, waiting times as well as answers to key questions regarding cleanliness, safety, and satisfaction. Another DataFrame named categories was created, containing all correct possible values for the survey columns.

In this exercise, you will use both of these DataFrames to find survey answers with inconsistent values, and drop them, effectively performing an outer and inner join on both these DataFrames as seen in the video exercise. The pandas package has been imported as pd, and the airlines and categories DataFrames are in your environment.

Instructions

Print the categories DataFrame and take a close look at all possible correct categories of the survey columns.

Print the unique values of the survey columns in airlines using the .unique() method.

Create a set out of the cleanliness column in airlines using set() and find the inconsistent category by finding the difference in the cleanliness column of categories.

Find rows of airlines with a cleanliness value not in categories and print the output.

Print the rows with the consistent categories of cleanliness only.

import pandas as pd
airlines = pd.read_csv('datasets/airlines_final.csv', index_col=0)
airlines.head()

categories = pd.read_csv('datasets/categories.txt', index_col=0)
categories.head()

# Print categories DataFrame
print(categories)

# Print unique values of survey columns in airlines
print('Cleanliness: ', airlines['cleanliness'].unique(), "\n")
print('Safety: ', airlines['safety'].unique(), "\n")
print('Satisfaction: ', airlines['satisfaction'].unique(), "\n")

# Find the cleanliness category in airlines not in categories
cat_clean = set(airlines['cleanliness']).difference(categories['cleanliness'])

# Find rows with that category
cat_clean_rows = airlines['cleanliness'].isin(cat_clean)

# Print rows with inconsistent category
print(airlines[cat_clean_rows])

# Not sure if the output is correct but the code is!

# Find the cleanliness category in airlines not in categories
cat_clean = set(airlines['cleanliness']).difference(categories['cleanliness'])

# Find rows with that category
cat_clean_rows = airlines['cleanliness'].isin(cat_clean)

# Print rows with inconsistent category
print(airlines[cat_clean_rows])

# Print rows with consistent categories only
print(airlines[~cat_clean_rows])

Inconsistent categories
In this exercise, you'll be revisiting the airlines DataFrame from the previous lesson.

As a reminder, the DataFrame contains flight metadata such as the airline, the destination, waiting times as well as answers to key questions regarding cleanliness, safety, and satisfaction on the San Francisco Airport.

In this exercise, you will examine two categorical columns from this DataFrame, dest_region and dest_size respectively, assess how to address them and make sure that they are cleaned and ready for analysis. The pandas package has been imported as pd, and the airlines DataFrame is in your environment.

Instructions

Print the unique values in dest_region and dest_size respectively.

Change the capitalization of all values of dest_region to lowercase.

Replace the 'eur' with 'europe' in dest_region using the .replace() method.

Strip white spaces from the dest_size column using the .strip() method.

Verify that the changes have been into effect by printing the unique values of the columns using .unique() .

# Print unique values of both columns
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())

# Print unique values of both columns
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())

# Lower dest_region column and then replace "eur" with "europe"
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].str.lower()
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].replace({'eur':'europe'})

# Print unique values of both columns
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())

# Lower dest_region column and then replace "eur" with "europe"
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].str.lower() 
airlines['dest_region'] = airlines['dest_region'].replace({'eur':'europe'})

# Remove white spaces from `dest_size`
airlines['dest_size'] = airlines['dest_size'].str.strip()

# Verify changes have been effected
print(airlines['dest_region'].unique())
print(airlines['dest_size'].unique())

Remapping categories
To better understand survey respondents from airlines, you want to find out if there is a relationship between certain responses and the day of the week and wait time at the gate.

The airlines DataFrame contains the day and wait_min columns, which are categorical and numerical respectively. The day column contains the exact day a flight took place, and wait_min contains the amount of minutes it took travelers to wait at the gate. To make your analysis easier, you want to create two new categorical variables:

wait_type: 'short' for 0-60 min, 'medium' for 60-180 and long for 180+ day_week: 'weekday' if day is in the weekday, 'weekend' if day is in the weekend. The pandas and numpy packages have been imported as pd and np. Let's create some new categorical data!

Instructions

Create the ranges and labels for the wait_type column mentioned in the description above.
Create the wait_type column by from wait_min by using pd.cut(), while inputting label_ranges and label_names in the correct arguments.
Create the mapping dictionary mapping weekdays to 'weekday' and weekend days to 'weekend'.
Create the day_week column by using .replace().
import numpy as np

# Create ranges for categories
label_ranges = [0, 60, 180, np.inf]
label_names = ['short', 'medium', 'long']

# Create wait_type column
airlines['wait_type'] = pd.cut(airlines['wait_min'], bins = label_ranges, 
                                labels = label_names)

# Create mappings and replace
mappings = {'Monday':'weekday', 'Tuesday':'weekday', 'Wednesday': 'weekday', 
            'Thursday': 'weekday', 'Friday': 'weekday', 
            'Saturday': 'weekend', 'Sunday': 'weekend'}

airlines['day_week'] = airlines['day'].replace(mappings)
print(airlines['day_week'] )

Removing titles and taking names
While collecting survey respondent metadata in the airlines DataFrame, the full name of respondents was saved in the full_name column. However upon closer inspection, you found that a lot of the different names are prefixed by honorifics such as "Dr.", "Mr.", "Ms." and "Miss".

Your ultimate objective is to create two new columns named first_name and last_name, containing the first and last names of respondents respectively. Before doing so however, you need to remove honorifics.

The airlines DataFrame is in your environment, alongside pandas as pd.

Instructions

Remove "Dr.", "Mr.", "Miss" and "Ms." from full_name by replacing them with an empty string "" in that order.
Run the assert statement using .str.contains() that tests whether full_name still contains any of the honorifics.
# Replace "Dr." with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Dr.","")

# Replace "Mr." with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Mr.","")

# Replace "Miss" with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Miss","")

# Replace "Ms." with empty string ""
airlines['full_name'] = airlines['full_name'].str.replace("Ms.","")

# Assert that full_name has no honorifics
assert airlines['full_name'].str.contains('Ms.|Mr.|Miss|Dr.').any() == False
Keeping it descriptive
To further understand travelers' experiences in the San Francisco Airport, the quality assurance department sent out a qualitative questionnaire to all travelers who gave the airport the worst score on all possible categories. The objective behind this questionnaire is to identify common patterns in what travelers are saying about the airport.

Their response is stored in the survey_response column. Upon a closer look, you realized a few of the answers gave the shortest possible character amount without much substance. In this exercise, you will isolate the responses with a character count higher than 40 , and make sure your new DataFrame contains responses with 40 characters or more using an assert statement.

The airlines DataFrame is in your environment, and pandas is imported as pd.

Instructions

Using the airlines DataFrame, store the length of each instance in the survey_response column in resp_length by using .str.len().
Isolate the rows of airlines with resp_length higher than 40.
Assert that the smallest survey_response length in airlines_survey is now bigger than 40.
# Store length of each row in survey_response column
resp_length = airlines['survey_response'].str.len()

# Find rows in airlines where resp_length > 40
airlines_survey = airlines[resp_length > 40]

# Assert minimum survey_response length is > 40
assert airlines_survey['survey_response'].str.len().min() > 40

# Print new survey_response column
print(airlines_survey['survey_response'])


3. Advanced data problems
In this chapter, you’ll dive into more advanced data cleaning problems, such as ensuring that weights are all written in kilograms instead of pounds. You’ll also gain invaluable skills that will help you verify that values have been added correctly and that missing values don’t negatively impact your analyses.

Uniform currencies
In this exercise and throughout this chapter, you will be working with a retail banking dataset stored in the banking DataFrame. The dataset contains data on the amount of money stored in accounts (acct_amount), their currency (acct_cur), amount invested (inv_amount), account opening date (account_opened), and last transaction date (last_transaction) that were consolidated from American and European branches.

You are tasked with understanding the average account size and how investments vary by the size of account, however in order to produce this analysis accurately, you first need to unify the currency amount into dollars. The pandas package has been imported as pd, and the banking DataFrame is in your environment.

Instructions

Find the rows of acct_cur in banking that are equal to 'euro' and store them in the variable acct_eu.
Find all the rows of acct_amount in banking that fit the acct_eu condition, and convert them to USD by multiplying them with 1.1.
Find all the rows of acct_cur in banking that fit the acct_eu condition, set them to 'dollar'.
import pandas as pd
banking = pd.read_csv('datasets/banking.csv')
banking.head()

# Find values of acct_cur that are equal to 'euro'
acct_eu = banking['acct_cur'] == 'euro'

# Convert acct_amount where it is in euro to dollars
banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_amount'] = banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_amount'] * 1.1

# Unify acct_cur column by changing 'euro' values to 'dollar'
banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_cur'] = 'dollar'

# Assert that only dollar currency remains
assert banking['acct_cur'].unique() == 'dollar'

# lack of data in the given datasets

Uniform dates
After having unified the currencies of your different account amounts, you want to add a temporal dimension to your analysis and see how customers have been investing their money given the size of their account over each year. The account_opened column represents when customers opened their accounts and is a good proxy for segmenting customer activity and investment over time.

However, since this data was consolidated from multiple sources, you need to make sure that all dates are of the same format. You will do so by converting this column into a datetime object, while making sure that the format is inferred and potentially incorrect formats are set to missing. The banking DataFrame is in your environment and pandas was imported as pd.

Instructions

Print the header of account_opened from the banking DataFrame and take a look at the different results.

Convert the account_opened column to datetime, while making sure the date format is inferred and that erroneous formats that raise error return a missing value.

Extract the year from the amended account_opened column and assign it to the acct_year column.

Print the newly created acct_year column.

# Print the header of account_opend
print(banking['account_opened'].head())

# Convert account_opened to datetime
banking['account_opened'] = pd.to_datetime(banking['account_opened'],
                                           # Infer datetime format
                                           infer_datetime_format = True,
                                           # Return missing value for error
                                           errors = 'coerce') 

# Get year of account opened
banking['acct_year'] = banking['account_opened'].dt.strftime('%Y')

# Print acct_year
print(banking['acct_year'])
How's our data integrity?
New data has been merged into the banking DataFrame that contains details on how investments in the inv_amount column are allocated across four different funds A, B, C and D.

Furthermore, the age and birthdays of customers are now stored in the age and birth_date columns respectively.

You want to understand how customers of different age groups invest. However, you want to first make sure the data you're analyzing is correct. You will do so by cross field checking values of inv_amount and age against the amount invested in different funds and customers' birthdays. Both pandas and datetime have been imported as pd and dt respectively.

Instructions

Find the rows where the sum of all rows of the fund_columns in banking are equal to the inv_amount column.

Store the values of banking with consistent inv_amount in consistent_inv, and those with inconsistent ones in inconsistent_inv.

Store today's date into today, and manually calculate customers' ages and store them in ages_manual.

Find all rows of banking where the age column is equal to ages_manual and then filter banking into consistent_ages and inconsistent_ages.

# Store fund columns to sum against
fund_columns = ['fund_A', 'fund_B', 'fund_C', 'fund_D']

# Find rows where fund_columns row sum == inv_amount
inv_equ = banking[fund_columns].sum(axis=1) == banking['inv_amount']

# Store consistent and inconsistent data
consistent_inv =  banking[inv_equ]
inconsistent_inv = banking[~inv_equ]

# Store consistent and inconsistent data
print("Number of inconsistent investments: ", inconsistent_inv.shape[0])
# Store today's date and find ages
today = dt.date.today()
ages_manual = today.year - banking['birth_date'].dt.year

# Find rows where age column == ages_manual
age_equ = ages_manual == banking['age']

# Store consistent and inconsistent data
consistent_ages = banking[age_equ]
inconsistent_ages = banking[~age_equ]

# Store consistent and inconsistent data
print("Number of inconsistent ages: ", inconsistent_ages.shape[0])

Missing investors
Dealing with missing data is one of the most common tasks in data science. There are a variety of types of missingness, as well as a variety of types of solutions to missing data.

You just received a new version of the banking DataFrame containing data on the amount held and invested for new and existing customers. However, there are rows with missing inv_amount values.

You know for a fact that most customers below 25 do not have investment accounts yet, and suspect it could be driving the missingness. The pandas, missingno and matplotlib.pyplot packages have been imported as pd, msno and plt respectively. The banking DataFrame is in your environment.

Instructions

Print the number of missing values by column in the banking DataFrame.

Plot and show the missingness matrix of banking with the msno.matrix() function.

Isolate the values of banking missing values of inv_amount into missing_investors and with non-missing inv_amount values into investors.

Sort the banking DataFrame by the age column and plot the missingness matrix of banking_sorted.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import missingno as msno

# Print number of missing values in banking
print(banking['inv_amount'].isna().sum())

# Visualize missingness matrix
msno.matrix(banking)
plt.show()
# Print number of missing values in banking
print(banking.isna().sum())

# Visualize missingness matrix
msno.matrix(banking)
plt.show()

# Isolate missing and non missing values of inv_amount
missing_investors = banking[banking['inv_amount'].isna()]
investors = banking[~banking['inv_amount'].isna()]
# Print number of missing values in banking
print(banking.isna().sum())

# Visualize missingness matrix
msno.matrix(banking)
plt.show()

# Isolate missing and non missing values of inv_amount
missing_investors = banking[banking['inv_amount'].isna()]
investors = banking[~banking['inv_amount'].isna()]

# Sort banking by age and visualize
banking_sorted = banking.sort_values('age')
msno.matrix(banking_sorted)
plt.show()
Follow the money
In this exercise, you're working with another version of the banking DataFrame that contains missing values for both the cust_id column and the acct_amount column.

You want to produce analysis on how many unique customers the bank has, the average amount held by customers and more. You know that rows with missing cust_id don't really help you, and that on average acct_amount is usually 5 times the amount of inv_amount.

In this exercise, you will drop rows of banking with missing cust_ids, and impute missing values of acct_amount with some domain knowledge.

Instructions

Use .dropna() to drop missing values of the cust_id column in banking and store the results in banking_fullid.
Use inv_amount to compute the estimated account amounts for banking_fullid by setting the amounts equal to inv_amount * 5, and assign the results to acct_imp.
Impute the missing values of acct_amount in banking_fullid with the newly created acct_imp using .fillna().
# Drop missing values of cust_id
banking_fullid = banking.dropna(subset = ['cust_id'])

# Compute estimated acct_amount
acct_imp = banking_fullid['inv_amount']*5

# Impute missing acct_amount with corresponding acct_imp
banking_imputed = banking_fullid.fillna({'acct_amount':acct_imp})

# Print number of missing values
print(banking_imputed.isna().sum())
4. Record linkage
Record linkage is a powerful technique used to merge multiple datasets together, used when values have typos or different spellings. In this chapter, you'll learn how to link records by calculating the similarity between strings—you’ll then use your new skills to join two restaurant review datasets into one clean master dataset.

The cutoff point
In this exercise, and throughout this chapter, you'll be working with the restaurants DataFrame which has data on various restaurants. Your ultimate goal is to create a restaurant recommendation engine, but you need to first clean your data.

This version of restaurants has been collected from many sources, where the cuisine_type column is riddled with typos, and should contain only italian, american and asian cuisine types. There are so many unique categories that remapping them manually isn't scalable, and it's best to use string similarity instead.

Before doing so, you want to establish the cutoff point for the similarity score using the fuzzywuzzy's process.extract() function by finding the similarity score of the most distant typo of each category.

Instructions

Import process from fuzzywuzzy.
Store the unique cuisine_types into unique_types.
Calculate the similarity of 'asian', 'american', and 'italian' to all possible cuisine_types using process.extract(), while returning all possible matches.
import pandas as pd
restaurants = pd.read_csv('datasets/restaurants_L2_dirty.csv')
restaurants.head()

# Import process from fuzzywuzzy
from fuzzywuzzy import process

# Store the unique values of cuisine_type in unique_types
unique_types = restaurants['type'].unique()

# Calculate similarity of 'asian' to all values of unique_types
print(process.extract('asian', unique_types, limit = len(unique_types)))

# Calculate similarity of 'american' to all values of unique_types
print(process.extract('american', unique_types, limit = len(unique_types)))

# Calculate similarity of 'italian' to all values of unique_types
print(process.extract('italian', unique_types, limit = len(unique_types)))
